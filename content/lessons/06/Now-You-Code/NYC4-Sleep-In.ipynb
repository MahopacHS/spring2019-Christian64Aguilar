Our criteria will be as follows.\n\n- Is it the weekend? Then sleep in.\n- Is it a holiday? Then sleep in.\n- Otherwise you need to get up!\n\nLet's write a program to input the day of the week and ask whether or not its a holiday, then make the appropriate decision as to whether or not we should sleep in.\n\nWe will use the **Write - Refactor - Test - Rewrite** approach to complete the final solution which will refactor the day of the week logic into a function."

Why did we need to write 7 tests? - to check if it works properly.\n3. Which code is easier to understand? Step 1 or step 4? Why? or Why not? - step one because its the basic coding not the editing part so its much more managable.\n4. What happens when you input `'sat'` for `'Saturday'` Does it work? How can the program be improved? Does improving it affect the readability of step 4? (HINT: Abstractions!!!) - it does work, thne program can be improved with a working BREAK statement, it can help with step 4.\n"
