Is this an error? because we didn't put in a string that wont accept negative numbers, no its not unless we programmed it to.\n\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain. no because you would right the same thing you did for C to F but just a different formula \n\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why? because checking each line makes sure that your code is running smoothly unless changes are needed to be made.\n"
