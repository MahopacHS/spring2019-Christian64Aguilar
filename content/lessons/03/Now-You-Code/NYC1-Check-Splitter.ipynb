What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60? when you enter two instead of 2 it will accept it and for 60 dollars and 60 it will not accept 60 because you put 60 dollars as a float.\n\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code? this is the syntax error, yea i can believed that the syntax error can be handled by code.\n\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? when the user types 0.5 as a number normally it wont run because you didn't modify the code to make decimals run-able and it does make sense to use decimals like whole numbers.\n"
