What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or 60 instead of $60? \n(as for the money 60 and $60 have equal value of 60 but as for 2 and two will become a error bcause its not the correct format)\n\n2. Why do you think this happens? because your looking for the number two not the word and for money you need \nI think this happens because its asking for an integer value not so much an character value so its looking for a number not a word as for 60/$60 i belive it wont matter cause 60=60\n\n3.Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? \nit won't count because its a decimal not a whole number \n\n\n"
