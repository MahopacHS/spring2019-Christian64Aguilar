What happens when you enter an age of `-50`? - if you put in the age -50 it will run saying that you cant vote or retire because anything less than eighteen cannot vote Does the program still run?- yes the program still runs  Fix your program so that it says `That's not an age` when a value less than zero is entered.\n3.
